Rules for casting objects/classes
1) We can store a child class object inside a parent type variable because
inheritance is one way from Parent to child.
2) we can create arrays of type Parent and can store all the objects of
child classes inside that array then we can write loops to call all the
methods from all the classes.
3) we can not store/cast a parent class object to child class variable but
if parent type variable already contains the child object then we can
get it back by casting it.
